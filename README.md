<h3 align="center">A general purpose Discord bot</h3>

Ryuko is a discord bot created in JavaScript (Node.js). It is currently a project of mine to learn JavaScript and other development tools. This bot was initially written with the library [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and using [Discord-Akairo](https://github.com/discord-akairo/discord-akairo) as the framework. Though I re-coded the whole project after experimenting with another library and framework called [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) and [Sylphy](https://github.com/pyraxo/sylphy) respectively. This is just a for fun personal project.
